# Jack Skeleton

## Why Renew a Dead Framework?

Loved the simplicity of [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) and it's use cases! But one thing it's old in dog years! It's lacking auto-prefixing, flexbox, variables, and could use some components to make it even more useful without having to use Bootstrap or Bulma! Plus I wanted something new and different with very minimal bloat at the same time without having to reinvent the wheel for more populare edge cases, like modals, and tooltips!

## Getting Started
*Coming Soon*

## Special Thanks!

I wanted to especially thank @dhg on GitHub for writing such a nice minimalistic CSS framework that wasn't trying to copy everyone else! Bulma, for project structure and inspiration! A lot of structures and methods
were migrated over from Bulma to help develop and make it easier for developers to customize Jack Skeleton!
