## Why Renew a Dead Framework?

Loved the simplicity of Skeleton and it's use cases! But one thing it's old in dog years! It's lacking auto-prefixing, flexbox, variables, and could use some components to make it even more useful without having to use Bootstrap or Bulma! Plus I wanted something new and different with very minimal bloat at the same time without having to reinvent the wheel for more populare edge cases, like modals, and tooltips!
